Mahadev = For me he is my father, whatever I request from him , he gave me that thing and I love him deeply
Krishna = For me he is my friend(The Friend) , All time he teaches me new things and also he supports my family, but to be honest my friends magic is so deep and hard that even me with my father always lose in his magic but all that is his love towards us
ShreeRam = The one from whom I thought that be kind is also possible with enough strength ,, I always request for my mother
